knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(commonTFfinder)
```

To list all functions available in the package:
```{r}
ls("package:commonTFfinder")
```

To list all datasets available in the package:
```{r}
data(package = "commonTFfinder")
```

## Workflow
This package is intended to compare sequences of interest from ChIP-seq data. However, some functions have not been developed, so only certain types of analysis are possible.
