## Description

The goal of commonTFfinder is to identify common transcription factor
(TF) binding sites among different genes from user provided ChIP-seq
data. This package is intended to compare sequences of interest from
ChIP-seq data. However, some functions have not been developed, so only
certain types of analysis are possible.

## Installation

You can install the development version of commonTFfinder from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RochelleRuoxuanWang/commonTFfinder")
library("commonTFfinder")
```

To run the Shiny app:

``` r
runTestingPackage()
```

## Overview

``` r
ls("package:commonTFfinder")
data(package = "commonTFfinder")
```

The \*\* function.  

The package also contains an ChIP-seq data set cstest. Refer to package
vignettes for more details.

``` r
browseVignettes("commonTFfinder")
```
